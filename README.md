## Packages

This project uses Nuget, but dependency management with Unity is a bit of
a mess given that it uses .NET 2.0 / C# 3.5, so the following is a record of
workarounds required for each installed package.

- NetMQ v4
  - Delete all folders and meta files except for `net35` in for both NetMQ and AsyncIO packages
  - [ ] Figure out how to only install net35 dep
    - Setting targetFramework does not appear to work
- Flatbuffers
  - Install flatc compiler
  - Mac: brew install flatbuffers
  - PC: Download latest flatc exe https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/releases
  - Compile flatbuffers into Assets/Scripts/flatbuffers/compiled
