- [X] Add time stamp to FlatNetworkedObject

- [X] Add velocity to FlatNetworkedObject

- [X] [Secondary] Check current object position against expected position from
  lerp; if different, do not lerp, and send update to primary; attach to the
  sent update the timestamp received from the primary for this frame

  - Example: Secondary is lerping update with timestamp 1234 from primary. It
    checks the current position of the object and finds that it does not match
    the expected position from the update, so it frees itself from lerping and
    sends an update to the primary every 33 ms with its new position,
    timestamping those updates with the most recent primary update starting
    with 1234.

- [X] [Primary] When an update is received from a secondary, it has already been
  checked for differences on the secondary, so trust that it is divergent

- [X] [Primary] When update is received from secondary, extrapolate p/r/v
  from the given timestamp to the current time (both are in terms of the
  primary's game clock, so the comparison is valid).

- [X] [Primary] Continue to send the nth frame (newest) to all secondary peers

- [X] [Unchanged secondaries] Lerp over updates from primary like usual

- [X] [Changed secondary] Add updates from primary to buffer like usual and do 
  the same check and lerp described above

  - Example: In ball rolling case, position will converge with updates from 
    primary over time, and eventually delta encoding will be zero and no
    updates will be sent to the primary

  - Example: In the box held by a player case, position will converge with
    updates from the primary only when the object is set down (no longer
    experiencing erratic movement from the player)

For tomorrow:

- [ ] Implement StoredTransform.IsEqual

- [ ] Free secondary object from single 33ms cycle and send an update to the primary.
