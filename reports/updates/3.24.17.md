Here's what I did this week:

- Set up syncing between two different devices on my home network

  - This will be aided by my Networks project, a directory service broker

  - Video: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BybVI6fYBiyFM2I3eTkwWDdFVWs

- Set up arbitrary object syncing

  - When a new object is created on a client and registered as a primary
    object, it is then synced to other clients and registered as secondary
    objects on them

  - Works both for objects that are there before the second client connects and
    objects that are created after the second client connects

  - Video: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BybVI6fYBiyFNUJMZjZHVUF2VEk

- Set up hooks for creating and registering objects at run time

  - This will be helpful for my final report, when I wish to measure
    performance where objects are all hosted on one device (client-server)
    versus spread out among peers (p2p)

  - Right now, only spheres are created when I click, but I can bind other
    objects as well

- Laid groundwork for reverse syncing (i.e. syncing from secondary to primary)

  - Will finish this next week

My code, which I haven't merged yet, is here on the dup-objects branch:
https://github.com/dblarons/NetworkedVR/compare/dup-objects?expand=1

Before I merge the code, I plan to do the following:

- Remove the two default objects that spawn when the primary client connects

- Renaming and cleaning to make the code nicer to work with (it's sort of
  a rough draft right now and requires some clean up)
