Here's a list of things I did this week:

- Wrote a wrapper class for the flatbuffer builder that does three things:

  - Given an object, produces bytes of the flatbuffer representation of the
    object (position, rotation, and in future the GUID)

  - Given a some bytes, produces the flatbuffer

  - Given a flatbuffer representation and an object, Lerps the object

- Added rotation syncing, so now objects move and rotate like you would expect

- Wrote comments and cleaned up my code from last week; merged PR

- Tried syncing from my desktop (windows) to my laptop (mac), but was not able
  to get it to work (only spent about 30 minutes on it, though). I just tried
  using the internal IP address to identify each other, but the object was not
  syncing. I will need to do a deeper dive to figure out why, perhaps looking
  at my computer network settings or inspecting where the packets are going.

----------

Overall, not as much to show visually as last week. I'm hoping to be syncing an
arbitrary number of objects by next week, and perhaps creating and syncing new
objects with a keystroke as well so that any client can be a primary owner.

Regarding my networking project, I found that NetMQ (C# ZeroMQ lib) already has
a Beacon implementation, so I decided to do a directory service. I'll forward
you the email chain with _____ which contains my proposal. It should make
life easier so that I don't have to manually change the IP settings like I was
doing to test on my Mac.
