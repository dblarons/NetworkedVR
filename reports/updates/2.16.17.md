I've updated the README with directions for building an executable to be run on
Linux. In short, you build a Linux executable on your Windows or Mac instance
of Unity with the headless option enabled, and then move that executable onto
a Linux machine. When headless mode is enabled, an X server does not need to be
running on the Linux box and the box does not need to have a graphics card.

I'm still working on the architecture diagram and updates to the paper and will
send them to you tomorrow morning.
