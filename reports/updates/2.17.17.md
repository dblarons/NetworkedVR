Looking forward to speaking with you both again this evening. Here's what I've
done this week:

- Researched building on Linux (contents of previous email)
- Added more detail about each paper that I read to my report
- Wrote a short section on Google Spanner
- Read more of the Blockchain paper and added a section about it to my report
- Read about Ethereum and added a section about it to my report
- Wrote about the hardware and software components that will be used
- Wrote about the software architecture
- Added details about what measurements I want to show

Here's the Docs link again: ____

Attached you will find a PDF version of the same document in the Google Doc.

What I didn't have time to finish:

Setting up a second camera in my Unity application that can be used when a Vive
is not present. It requires updating the VR Toolkit library that I depend on
and was a bit more work than I expected it to be. I'll finish it up tomorrow
(Saturday).
