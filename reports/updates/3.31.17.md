Finished cleaning up one-way synchronization PR and merged my code: https://github.com/dblarons/NetworkedVR/pull/11

## Wednesday, 3/28

- Move all weekly updates and papers (still in pdf format) into repo

- TODO: Convert papers to markdown

## Thursday, 3/29

- Refactor to only send updates from objects when they have moved

- diff: https://github.com/dblarons/NetworkedVR/compare/delta-encoding?expand=1

- Refactor to buffer updates on a per-object basis, rather than on a universal basis (same diff as above)

- Spent time thinking about how updates for secondary objects can be distinguished from interpolation as a result of existing primary updates

  - Ball rolling case: Updates from a secondary to a primary for a ball that is rolling will look "behind"
    to the primary; there is potential that it gets confused and reverses the ball's direction

  - Ping pong case: If ball is on primary, when secondary hits ball it does not interact with the ball
    directly, but rather uses an intermediary object to interact with the ball

    - Therefore, cannot set a flag on an object to signify that it is being interacted with

  - Best option is to tag and keep a backlog of updates on the primary; secondary will send the two tags it is
    interpolating between and t value along with its update to the primary; primary will compare the secondary's 
    update position with the interpolated value, and if it is different, update itself
    
    - In the literature: state resolution

  - Still unknown: When secondary interacts with object, object will still be getting interpolated over by the 
    primary

    - Possible solution: Check secondary position with expected interpolated position before applying the new
      interpolated position; if expected position does not equal matched position, "free" the object from
      interpolation for this time interval
