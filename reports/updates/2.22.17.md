I looked further into UDP support for ZeroMQ and the C# implementation that
I use, NetMQ. I'd like to have UDP multicast support, which is the ZeroMQ
radio/dish pattern.

I found that radio/dish was added to two implementations, libzmq and czmq,
a few months ago by somdoron, the same guy who maintains NetMQ, but he hasn't
yet added it for NetMQ.

Here's his original announcement of radio/dish support:
https://lists.zeromq.org/pipermail/zeromq-dev/2016-March/030032.html

And at the bottom of this thread he mentions possibly porting it to NetMQ:
https://github.com/zeromq/netmq/issues/515

The zmq_udp docs are here:
http://api.zeromq.org/4-2:zmq-udp

Given the timeline of my project, I have two choices:

1. Use TCP for communicating between peers. The downside here is that TCP may
   become a bottleneck in my implementation. It doesn't suit the problem domain
   very well.

2. Use another library. I did some research and found that the lidgren library
   is well suited for my needs. It came recommended on a few sites where p2p
   Unity communication was discussed.

What do you think? My preference is to switch libraries in the interest of
time. I haven't yet tried lidgren, so that will be my next step.
