- Introduction
  - Quorom systems were susceptible to the Sybil attack where many peers inject false information
  - (p. 2) 2.1 The Starting Point
    - Transaction (TX): Signed contract verifiable with a public key
    - Coins need serial numbers to be uniquely identifiable
  - (p. 3) 2.2 Proof of Work
    - Block chain is the distributed ledger
    - Bitcoin uses proof of work to solve for double spending and Sybil attacks
    - The ability to verify depends on computing power rather than number of peers
      - Harder to fake computing power than number of peers
